VM Manager
==========

This manages QEMU VMs via a REST API, which is a surprisingly
hard to find feature in pre-build solutions.

Build

```
$ go build .
```

Run Prod
--------

```
$ ./vm-manager -p <port>
```

e.g.

```
$ ./vm-manager -p 1701
```

- TBD

FOR DEVELOPERS - API
--------------------

- GET  /vm           : returns JSON blob of started VMs
- POST /vm/start/:id : starts vm id
- POST /vm/kill/:id  : stops vm id with `kill -9`
